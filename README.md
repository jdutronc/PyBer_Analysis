# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Project

We have just joined PyBer, a Python-based ride-sharing app, and our first assignment is to analyze large sets of ride-sharing data and create vizualizations to showcase the relationship between the type of city, the number of drivers and riders as well as percentages of fares, riders and drivers by type of city. We have impressed the CEO with our initial analysis and we have now been tasked with creating a summary of key metrics by type of city and a multiple-line graph to show the total weekly fares by city type. This new analysis will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for under-served neighborhoods.

## Results

Our new DataFrame for each city type returns the following results:

We can easily see that overall rural areas are under-served:
- the number of rides in rural areas is 13 times and 5 times lower than in urban and suburban areas respectively.
- the number of drivers in rural areas is much lower than in suburban and urban areas (31 times and 6 times lower respectively) which creates a lack of competition in those areas and inflates fares for the customer.
- Average fares per driver in rural areas are 40% and 235% higher than in suburban and urban areas respectively.
- Ultimately this situation is not only detrimental to customers, but also represents a massive loss of profit / untapped revenue opportunity for PyBer. Revenue generated from rural areas only accounts for 7% of the total.

The multiple-line chart pictured right shows the total fare generated by PyBer drivers from Jan. 1st to Apr. 28th 2019. We can see that rural areas consisently bring in a small fraction of the revenue that suburban and urban areas do: only a quarter of suburban areas and an eighth of urban areas! All three graph lines are relatively flat over the course of the 4 months and it's difficult to identify any general trend.
